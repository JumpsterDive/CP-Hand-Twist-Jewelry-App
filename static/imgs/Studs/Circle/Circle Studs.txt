CIRCLE STUDS
 
These little circle studs are perfect for everyday wear. They are timeless and simple with the slightest imperfect shape that can only come from something made by hand. The wire has been worked with a hammer to create a flat, rustic hardware texture. Each unique pair is available in three different sizes, 7mm, 9mm, 12mm in diameter.
 
Available in sterling silver or 14k yellow gold filled.
 
All Hand Twist Jewelry is handcrafted by me in the Columbus, OH area.
