DOUBLE CIRCLE STUDS
 
These simple and classic little circle studs have a double loop design. They are unique by the addition of a smaller circle inside the outer circumference. They are lightweight and dainty making it a simple everyday wear. They are available in 2 different sizes measuring approximately, 9mm and 12mm in diameter.
 
Available in sterling silver or 14k yellow gold filled.
