OVATE STUDS
 
These earrings are a great classic style that you will want to wear every day. They are very sophisticated in an understated way, making them great for work or important meetings. The wire has been worked with a hammer to create a flat, rustic hardware texture. They measure approximately 13mm long, and 6mm wide.
 
Available in sterling silver or 14k yellow gold filled.
 
All Hand Twist Jewelry is handcrafted by me in the Columbus, OH area.
