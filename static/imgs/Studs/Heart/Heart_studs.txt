HEART STUDS
 
These perfectly simple little studs are a timeless classic style with the slightly organic shape that can only come from something made by hand. These heart studs are a perfect companion to a simple layering necklace, or a sweet little stud for a second (or third) hole. They measure approximately 5mm long by 6mm wide.
 
 
Available in sterling silver or 14k yellow gold filled.
 
All Hand Twist Jewelry is handcrafted by me in the Columbus, OH area.
