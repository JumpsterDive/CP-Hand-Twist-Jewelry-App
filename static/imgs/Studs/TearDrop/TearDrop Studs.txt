TEARDROP STUDS
 
Rustic and modern at the same time, these feather light studs are sculptural and feminine. They are a timeless elegant geometric shape perfect for everyday wear. The wire has been worked with a hammer to create a flat, rustic hardware texture. Hammered teardrops measure approximately 12mm long, and 8mm wide.
 
Available in sterling silver or 14k yellow gold filled.
 
All Hand Twist Jewelry is handcrafted by me in the Columbus, OH area.
